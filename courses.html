    <h1> <b> Express js</b></h1>
    <p> <b>INTRODUCTION:</b> <BR> Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set

         an easy-to-use API for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities. 
Express is built on top of Node.js and provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features. It is a lightweight and flexible routing framework with minimal core features meant to be augmented
 through the use of Express middleware modules. </p>

    <h1><b>Node js</b></h1>
    <p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b><BR>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript 
        code outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily used for front-end development, 
        running inside browsers to handle user interactions and dynamic content. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for 
        server-side development, allowing developers to build web servers, APIs, and other back-end applications.</p>
